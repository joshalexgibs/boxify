# racket-playground

A personal repo to upload small racket files I made to test and solidify my understanding and knowledge of DrRacket.
All files will not be related to one another;
However, the adventure-game.rkt file will use the ThoughtSTEM adventure language.
Some files will be finished versions of problem codes provided by the edx.org course, How to Code: Simple Data.
